# Speeduino R96 Engine Control Unit #

This is the project software repository for the Speeduino R96 Engine Control Unit (ECU).  R96 is both a company name and the name of a custom ECU for high-end applications.

This repository is a fork of Speeduino - a flexible, fully featured Engine Management System (EMS aka ECU) based on the low cost and open source Arduino platform. 

Since the R96 project is a fully custom effort, it is managed through a forked repository instead of the main Speeduino repository.  Custom source code is contained in files beginning with the `r96_` prefix with the objective of minimizing both the number and complexity of merge conflicts with the parent repository.  Speeduino is still a very active project with many contributors, and we intend to keep this repository up to date with the parent master repository.
